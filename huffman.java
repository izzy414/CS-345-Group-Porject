// Main function that takes the user input
// Frequencies function gets frequencies of string and puts it into hashmap (takes arguement of the string)
// Sort function sorts the hashmap by value
// Tree function creates the tree (takes the sorted hashmap as an argument)
   // Node object reates the nodes of the tree with number frequency, letter, L = 2K+1 and R = 2k+2
   // Puts the letters into nodes and creates third node with sum of it's children all the way to the root
   // Do recursive backtracking to get the bit values and store that value into our hashmap
// Print the hasmap in binary tree form
// Print the hashmap in tree form
